	The `init` function on our class is called just once, when the object
	is first created. Used to set up all variables in the class.

	Our Paddle should take an X and a Y, for positioning, as well as a width
	and height for its dimensions.

	Note that `self` is a reference to *this* object. Different objects can
	have their own x, y, width, and height values, thus serving as containers
	for data. In this sense, they're very similar to structs in C.
